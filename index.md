## A Gamified Training Platform Supported By AI



For our senior project, we want to make an education platform supported by artificial intelligence. Our project will consist of two parts, a desktop program running in the background and a mobile application. We also want to add gamified materials to increase the impact of the content.

Mentally, there will be two divided programs which are .Net based server with MsSql database at the backend side and React Native application at the frontend side. Also, artificial intelligence will be used for suggestions.

Instructors will be able to upload education materials such as videos, documents or slides according to related courses and subjects.

In addition, There will be online and offline quizzes to determine understanding levels of students. According to these outcomes, ML .Net based artificial intelligence facility will suggest specified education materials which contain missing parts about lectures. At the end of the day, Instructors will get the ability profile of their students.

Moreover, we are planning to add gamified materials such as leaderboards for competitions or badges to drain the attention of students.
